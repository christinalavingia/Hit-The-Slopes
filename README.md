## Overview

Our web app makes it convenient for skiers and snowboarders to find the resorts with the best snowfall nearby.

People who live near ski resorts can struggle to identify the best slopes to visit. They may have to compare data from multiple resorts’ websites and then consider trip time. The goal of our app is to identify the closest resort with fresh powder.

## Technology

* 3 Libraries: 1 CSS, and 2 JQuery including new jquery.validate 
  * https://jqueryvalidation.org/
* 3 API’s: 2 from Google, and 1 homebrewed featuring snow depth 
  * http://powderlin.es/api.html
* New Tech: IIFE (Immediately-Invoked Function Expression)

## Challenges

* APIs
  * Or, lack thereof. We would have liked to use this one but it was prohibitively expensive: https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/skiresort
* ZIP Code Verification
  * jquery.validate
* Printing to the DOM
  * IIFE
  
## Future Development

* We intended to have our dropdown menu sort the list for a more user-friendly experience
* We'd love to add in more APIs that note facts like open lifts to make our app even more comprehensive
